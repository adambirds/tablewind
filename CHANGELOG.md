# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [v4.0.1] - 2025-09-13

### Fixed

- **onEditSave Callback**: Fixed bug where the `revalidate` function was not being passed to the `onEditSave` callback, causing inline editing to not refresh data after successful saves
- **Type Definitions**: Updated `InlineEditCallbacks` interface to properly include the `revalidate` parameter in the `onEditSave` callback signature

## [v4.0.0] - 2025-09-12

### ðŸš¨ BREAKING CHANGES

- **Function Signatures Updated**: The `onRowSelect` callback now receives optional second and third parameters: `clearSelectionsAfterAction?: () => void, revalidate?: () => void`
- **Bulk Action Signatures Updated**: All `BulkAction` onClick handlers now receive optional second and third parameters: `clearSelectionsAfterAction?: () => void, revalidate?: () => void`

### Added

- **Selection Alert Feature**: New `showSelectionAlert` prop to display selection count when any items are selected (instead of only when all items are selected)
- **Keep Selected Option**: New `showKeepSelectedOption` prop to show a checkbox allowing users to keep selections after bulk actions
- **Data Revalidation Support**: Added `revalidate` function to callbacks, enabling data refresh without component re-mounting
- **Enhanced Bulk Actions**: Bulk actions now receive `clearSelectionsAfterAction` and `revalidate` functions for better control over selection state and data freshness

### Changed

- **CSS Variables**: Updated hardcoded colors in checkbox inputs to use consistent CSS variable theming system
- **Selection Persistence**: Improved selection state management to work better with data revalidation

### Migration Guide

#### Breaking Changes
1. **onRowSelect callback** (optional parameters added):
   ```tsx
   // Before
   onRowSelect?: (selectedIds: string[]) => void;
   
   // After  
   onRowSelect?: (
     selectedIds: string[], 
     clearSelectionsAfterAction?: () => void, 
     revalidate?: () => void
   ) => void;
   ```

2. **BulkAction onClick handlers** (optional parameters added):
   ```tsx
   // Before
   onClick: (selectedIds: string[]) => void;
   
   // After
   onClick: (
     selectedIds: string[], 
     clearSelectionsAfterAction?: () => void, 
     revalidate?: () => void
   ) => void;
   ```

#### Recommended Migration (for new features)
To use the new "keep selected" functionality, replace component re-mounting patterns with the new `revalidate` function:

```tsx
// Current approach (still works, but prevents "keep selected" from working)
const [refreshKey, setRefreshKey] = useState(0);
<DataTable key={refreshKey} {...props} />
```
```tsx
// Recommended approach (enables "keep selected" functionality)
<DataTable
  bulkActions={[
    {
      key: "delete",
      label: "Delete Selected",
      onClick: (
        selectedIds: string[],
        clearSelectionsAfterAction?: () => void,
        revalidate?: () => void
      ) => {
        performBulkAction(selectedIds).then(() => {
          revalidate?.();                 // Refresh data without losing selections
          clearSelectionsAfterAction?.(); // Conditionally clear based on user preference
        });
      },
    },
  ]}
  showSelectionAlert
  showKeepSelectedOption
  {...otherProps}
/>

```
